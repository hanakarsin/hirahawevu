Here is a look at her biography:</p><h3>Nationality and birthplace</h3><p class=align-left>Tia Torres was born on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">11th June 1960</a> as Tia Maria Torres, making her 59 years old. She was born in Southern California, in California, U.S.A. She is, therefore, a US citizen.</p><h3>Early life</h3><p class=align-left>Tia was born to a middle-class family, but her childhood was anything but smooth. Her parents who are unnamed, divorced and her father married another woman.</p><p class=align-left>On top of their broken home, her mother later died when she was still very young, living her to be raised by her step-mother. According to Tia, she was her role model and the person she considered to be her parental figure.</p><h3>Education background and passion for animals</h3><p class=align-left>There is not much that is known about Tia’s education background including which schools she attended. However, they are probably in Southern California, where she spent her childhood. What is known though about Tia Torres while younger is that she was very fond of animals from a very young age –a passion she attributes to her bond with her stepmother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f73ab4630959f67.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sidney Starr: real name, partner, life story, before and after pictures</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her love for animals started with her affection for horses as a little girl. Over time, she developed a huge interest in the welfare of animals, going from more than just caring for horses to taking in strays. It is thus not surprising that she would be an enthusiastic animal rescuer later in life.</p><h3>Leaving home and involvement with a gang</h3><p class=align-left>Like most young people, Tia felt the need to move away from home to discover herself. She left home at the age of 17 to search for and help strays and endangered animals. When leaving home, she left with her pets, including her horse. She encountered a number of challenges moving around with the animals, and sometimes even had to spend nights in her van with them. However, her love for animals persevered.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Renée Felice Smith biography, husband, siblings and parents</p><p class=align-left>All was not warm and sunny for Tia’s life away from home though. Along the way, while trying to discover herself, she got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">involved with a gang</a>. Her involvement lasted for quite a while, and during this time, she had a number of run-ins with the police, including instances where she escaped being shot at. However, she later left the gang, choosing to join the army.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a9c83be9af6879ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sofia Richie bio: net worth, photos, boyfriend, Instagram, age</span></p></a><h2>Tia Torres family</h2><p class=align-left>Looking to know more about the personal life of Tia Maria Torres? Below is a look at her personal relationships.</p><h3>Parents</h3><p class=align-left>There is not much information about Tia’s parents, with her father, biological mother, and step mother’s names not being mentioned. However, she has credited her stepmother for playing a huge role in her growing up.</p><p class=align-left>It was her stepmother's ideology that people should keep pets and treat them well that led to her developing a passion for animals. She has also claimed that her stepmother was a strict disciplinarian while she was growing up and that she developed a very close bond with her.</p><h3>Husband</h3><p class=align-left>Tia Torres is currently married to <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Aren Marcus Jackson</a>, whom she met in the 1980s when she was searching for the owner of a dog – who turned out to be Jackson. They would later reconnect in 2001, and at the time, he was serving a sentence stemming from his involvement in a shootout with the police. They became pen pals, and when he was released from prison, the couple tied the knot.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7f52171bba9d1022.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eiza González: 10 fast facts you should know about Timothée Chalamet girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jon Grissom biography, Corey Feldman accusations and facts</p><h3>Is Tia Torres still married?</h3><p class=align-left>Yes, she is married. Tia Torres' husband AJ Jackson is, however, currently in prison, having been arrested in 2007 having violated his parole.</p><p class=align-left>Aside from Jackson, Tia is rumoured to have been married before, though these claims are unconfirmed. What is known, however, is that she was in a relationship with a man, who is the biological daughter of one of her daughters, Tania Torres. However, the relationship later broke up due to claims of gang involvement, drug dealing and use, and abusiveness.</p><h3>Children</h3><p class=align-left>Tia has four children –two daughters: Tania and Maria Torres, and two twin sons Keli’l and Kanani. Tania is from her prior relationship before he met Jackson, while Maria is hers and Jackson’s biological daughter.</p><p class=align-left>Are Tia Torres twins adopted? Yes, the twin brothers, who are of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hawaii descent</a> are adopted but have been raised together as part of the family.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f5f9782f5e4c8158.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Natalie Tewa: Everything you need to know about the vlogger</span></p></a><h2>Tia Torres career</h2><p class=align-left>The animal rescuer has worn many hats over the last few decades. Here are the most notable jobs she has undertaken so far:</p><h3>Military</h3><p class=align-left>Was Tia Torres in the military? Yes! The violence of the gang life led her to want out, and it was during this time that she enlisted for the military. She posted high scores on her army entrance exams, and the recruiters recommended that she follow a medical path. However, she opted for a different course, and ended up attending a truck driving school and becoming an army truck driver for infantry troops.</p><p class=align-left>However, she would not last in the military forever. After <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">6 years</a> of serving her country, she decided to leave the army, returning to Los Angeles where she became a youth gang counsellor.</p><h3>Youth gang counsellor</h3><p class=align-left>Tia Torres was invited by Los Angeles City to be part of a programme aimed at young gang members, which was designed to help solve their issues peacefully without resorting to violence. Under the programme, she would go into gang neighbourhoods and talk with gang members and their parents. She would also offer counselling to members, to help them with among other issues, stay in school.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c3d1b587c242a2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exclusive: Amber Ray age, child, cars, house, is she married?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Keke Palmer's bio, twin sister, parents, net worth and boyfriend</p><h3>Animal rescue business</h3><p class=align-left>After leaving the army, Tia came across a pit bull in an animal shelter, who she adopted and named Tanaka. Tanaka became an integral part of her life, including her family. It was through her that she developed a love for the breed, which led to her founding <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Villalobos</a> (meaning “wolves village” in Spanish) Rescue Centre.</p><p class=align-left>This centre would grow to become one of the largest put bulls rescue facility in the U.S. As part of the rescue business, she runs training seminars, medical services, and obedience classes for pit bulls.</p><h3>Pit Bulls and Parolees</h3><p class=align-left>Tia’s pit bulls rescue centre is non-profit, something that saw her struggling with finances to fund the programme. This was the main reason that led her to become a TV Personality. Her famous TV show Pit Bulls & Parolees started airing in 2009 on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Animal Planet network</a>, and it follows her animal rescue work under the Villalobos Rescue Centre. The Pit Bulls and Parolees cast include Tia, her children, and parolees, who help her to rescue and rehabilitate pit bulls across the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4577a9fa089b917b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Samantha Logan - Height, family, boyfriend</span></p></a><h2>How much does Tia pay the parolees?</h2><p class=align-left>It is not known how much Tia Torres pays her parolees. Funds to cover their pay and other expenses come from adoption fees and donations from well-wishers. However, after becoming part of the Pit Bulls & Parolees programme, Animal Planet helped to pay for some of the rescue centre’s expenses, which at the time the show was starting were at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$25,000</a>.</p><h2>Did Pit Bulls and Parolees get cancelled?</h2><p class=align-left>No! The show is still on-going and it is set to return <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">later in 2019</a>. However, there has been a lot of controversy with her programme, with most critics not being fond of Tia Torres' dog training methods and advice.</p><p class=align-left>The controversy stems from critics who believe that pit bulls are too dangerous a dog, something that the show does not emphasize on. As a result, there has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a lot of campaigns</a> to remove the Pit Bulls & Parolees show from the air.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/317542a7c7b4f2e2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MLB host Lauren Shehadi biography: nationality, dating, salary, net worth</span></p></a><h2>Tia Torres' net worth</h2><p class=align-left>While most TV personalities are swimming in wealth and a life of glitz, Tia is not one of them. Despite her rather successful animal rescue centre and her TV show, she is only estimated to be worth approximately <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$300,000</a>. The reason for this is that her work is non-profit, and thus most of her income goes towards the animal rescue foundation.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Tiger Woods daughter, Sam Alexis Woods bio and photos through the years</p><p class=align-left>As for Tia’s income, there is no specific information about her salary, though most of the earnings come from the Pit Bulls and Parolees TV show, where the rescue centre <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earns money</a> from Animal Planet based on the number of viewers. There is also income from the centre’s adoption fees and donations from well-wishers.</p><p class=align-left>If you are looking to find out more about Tia Torres, the detailed guide above covers all the information about this animal lover turned TV personality. She has had a tough and interesting life, from a difficult childhood, troubled teenage years, military life and then, later on, her dedication to animal rescuing. However, she has managed to rise up above all these challenges, raising four kids, a task that she balances with her non-profit rescue facility and her TV career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/36fd28c9d82887dc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about Maria Bello</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> What happened to Luke Perry?
