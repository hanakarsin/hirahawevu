I know they will come after me but am prepared, I am ready for them.</p><p>“You should be strong and put your trust in God. I don’t stay close to people in power, particularly this kind of power, you see in life, I was looking around to see Governors, I know if Uche Nwosu is a sitting governor, you will see a lot of governors here.</p><p>“If Rochas was Governor you would have seen a lot of governors here, life is like that, for me now I don’t even live in the Government House. I have parked out, even though I still have two more years, I am tired so I had to leave.</p><p>“Particularly again when you have a system that is not doing well, the truth must be told. Many people don’t like the truth that is why they don’t like me.</p><p>“You said this is APC hall, I came here I didn’t see any APC member, today I’ve converted it to Christian hall. The way I do my thing, nobody can stop me or tell me who can be my friend. Nobody in this country can tell where to go, nobody,” Wike said.</p><p>He added: “I am happy he is no longer in power that is why I am coming close to him now to learn the experience of those who are no longer in power, so that by the time it gets to me I will be used to it.</p><p>“Owelle is facing a lot of crisis, it is not easy to pass through these crises but it will come but it will be over.</p><p>“I want to encourage you and your son-in-law to be strong. If it doesn’t happen like this you won’t know that God loves you. You will go through these battles for you to know that there is God. We have passed through these battles and we are still waiting to pass through them again.</p><p>“Just like Rochas, God has given everyone his talent, when I watch your son-in-law from far, I say you have a good son-in-law that is not arrogant, not a son-in-law that does not understand what marriage is all about, I wouldn’t have come. I will be in Imo State soon and I will tell them my mind. You should thank God”.</p><p>Meanwhile, a&nbsp;former Director of the Department of State Services (DSS), <strong>Mike Ejiofor</strong>, has revealed the reason for <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the recent reduction</a></strong> in cases of banditry across the country.</p><p>Speaking during an interview on Channels Television‘s programme ‘Sunrise Daily’ on Monday, Ejiofor said the reduction in the activities of bandits could be traced to Ramadan currently being observed by Muslims across the country.</p><p>Ejiofor said most of the bandits are religious people who are also observing Ramadan, which is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH11e5ByZqJlkaJ6s7HAnbBmnp%2BnerG7y6KropuRoXqxsdGsnJytpJ68r3nAn6ueql2ks6e1wp5ksKGbmnqlscKlmKudo2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-am-ready-for-political-persecution-after-office-wike-declares.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./breaking-inec-declares-winner-of-kebbi-governorship-election.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./breaking-inec-declares-winner-of-kebbi-governorship-election.html>INEC Declares Winner Of Kebbi Governorship Election</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gus-trikonis-html.html>Gus Trikonis - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gus-trikonis-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
