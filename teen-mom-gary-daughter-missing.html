He shares Leah with ex-girlfriend Amber and Emilee with wife Kristina. Gary has primary custody of both girls.</p><p>The family has appeared in media headlines for a number of different reasons in recent months.

"I’d say she’s one lucky girl! Has 2 mom’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@realamberlportwood1__</a> & <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kristina_shirley3</a> & 1 over protective papa!

The Teen Mom OG star opened up with producers of the show about how difficult it's been in an episode that premiered in September 2021.</p><p>“It’s been a while since I’ve seen her. She hasn’t even answered any of my text messages,” she said to the camera, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. “She’s not going to answer my phone calls. But she has a bonus mom, so … ridiculous way to speak, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Amber went on to say: "It truly breaks my heart that Leah and I are drifting apart. For the past six years, I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist. I really think if I could go to therapy with Leah, it would bring us closer together. But Gary and Kristina feel differently.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: MTV/YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Meanwhile, Leah has expressed hesitation when it comes to spending time with her mom. She initially didn't want to invite Amber to the family part of her birthday celebration.</p><p>"It's really important that, you know, you spend time with your mom," Gary encouraged her.</p><p>"I don't want to, though ... We don't really, like, have a bond like that," Leah replied. "Twelve years, and she hasn't really done anything. That's kind of been like Kristina's spot."</p><p>Kristina reminded her that she's just a bonus mom, while Gary said he didn't want Leah to write-off her mom and not have a relationship with her at all. (Ultimately, Leah did agree to invite her mother.)</p><p>Hopefully, Amber and Leah are able to repair their strained relationship — and hopefully, Gary has gotten more used to Emilee's hybrid school schedule and isn't missing her so much when she's learning in person.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Teen Mom: Family Reunion Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKmuoympqZll5a%2FunnDmqygoKSav265yKyqoqaX</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteen-mom-gary-daughter-missing.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./burna-boy-if-not-for-nigerian-leaders-i-would-have-won-grammy-years-ago.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./burna-boy-if-not-for-nigerian-leaders-i-would-have-won-grammy-years-ago.html>If Not For Nigerian Leaders, I Would Have Won Grammy Years Ago</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./december24-html.html>December 24 Horoscope and Zodiac</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./december24-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
