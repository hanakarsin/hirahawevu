And for Olympic Golfer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rory McIlroy</a>, that means being forced to choose between his hometown and the town he calls home. In 2016 Rory was given the option of whether to represent Britain or Ireland in Rio, but the athlete ultimately opted out of the competition altogether.</p><p>But it appears that Rory has had a change of heart. The professional golfer decided to tee up in Tokyo and fans were surprised to learn what team he’s representing. Despite growing up in Northern Ireland, he has previously pledged his allegiance to Britain in the past. So <a href=#>why is Rory playing for Ireland</a> in the <a href=#>2020 Summer Olympic Games</a>?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Rory McIlroy golfing for Ireland?</h2><p>Because Rory was born in Northern Ireland, he is technically a British national. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf Monthly</a> reported that Rory is still under the jurisdiction of Team Ireland according to the Golfing Union. In the past, Rory has expressed that he identifies with Britain more than his hometown and would ultimately choose Team GB if given the choice.</p><p>Rory has also been candid about the support he’s gotten from Ireland, which made his choice even more difficult, but said that he’s at peace with his decision. Regardless of who Rory is representing at the Olympics, he hasn’t been afraid to put his game face on.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of the summer games, Rory expressed that his motivations for competing at <a href=#>Tokyo 2020</a> have less to do with patriotism than his desire to win.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC Sports</span></figure><p>“I mean, look, I’m not a very patriotic guy. I’m doing it because I think it is the right thing to do," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told the BBC</a>. “I missed it last time, and for golf to be an Olympic sport, you need your best players there. I feel like I want to represent the game of golf more than anything else.”</p><p>Since qualifying for the Olympics. Rory has been noticeably underwhelmed. He explained at the 2020 PGA Tournament, “I don’t know if there is much to look forward to. It’s obviously going to be a very different environment.”</p><p>But that’s not the only thing that fans noticed about Rory’s performance at the 2020 Olympics. Viewers also noted that, unlike his teammates, Rory was lacking a certain accessory. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why wasn’t Rory wearing a hat</a> at the 2020 Olympics?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why wasn’t Rory McIlroy wearing a hat at the 2020 Olympics?</h2><p>Previously, Rory <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that the real reason he isn’t wearing his team’s customary hat at the Olympics this year is much less mysterious than you think and has absolutely nothing to do with his lack of patriotism.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Rory, his “pea-sized head” makes it impossible for him to find a hat that fits.</p><p>“I have such a small head. My head is so small that I have to get Nike to make me custom hats, so whenever I’m in a team event and the hats aren’t custom, they’re all too big,” Rory explained. Luckily, his headgear (or lack thereof) doesn’t affect his ability to play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKunoq56rq%2FIpamosV2cvK2yyKeeZp6fp3qqvsSlmKec</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-rory-mcilroy-golfing-for-ireland.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brett-goldstein-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brett-goldstein-dating.html>Actor Brett Goldstein Steals Hearts in 'Ted Lasso' Is He Dating Anyone?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ortom-vs-buhari-presidency-blasts-benue-governor-labels-him-a-failed-politician.html>Presidency Blasts Benue Governor, Labels Him A Failed Politician</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ortom-vs-buhari-presidency-blasts-benue-governor-labels-him-a-failed-politician.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
