But what about roommates who don’t seem to exist? Is this a nightmare or a dream? Spencer Hudson (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@_spencerhudson</a>) shared his <a href=#>roommate saga</a> on <a href=#>TikTok</a> about how he hasn’t met his roommates in two months at the apartment.</p><p>While that might sound ideal for some people, others might be perplexed. Where are Spencer’s roommates? Are they OK? And how is this even possible? TikTokers are tuned into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer’s roommate (or lack thereof) story</a> as we try to figure out what’s really going on beneath the surface.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@_spencerhudson</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Spencer has been living in his apartment for two months without meeting his roommates.</h2><p>Spencer shares, “I’ve been living in this apartment for about two months and I don’t know the names of my roommates. I've never met my roommates. I don't know if my roommates exist.” Off the bat, Spencer does not sound happy about his situation. He just sounds confused and even a little scared. Imagine living with people you’ve never met?!</p><p>“It's not a bad place but I'm just kind of convinced that I'm the only one who lives here,” he says as he shows us around the apartment. “There are four of us. It’s an 1,100-square-foot apartment, right? Me and three other guys, and I’m telling you, I’ve never seen them.” The entire time he tells us this, Spencer looks purely bewildered.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@_spencerhudson href=#>@_spencerhudson</a><p>If you are my roomate. And you see this video my name is Spencer. <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=roomate href=#>#roomate</a> <a title=men href=#>#men</a> <a title=apartment href=#>#apartment</a> <a title=college href=#>#college</a> <a title=xyz href=#>#xyz</a> <a title=xyzabc href=#>#xyzabc</a> <a title=xyzbc href=#>#xyzbc</a> <a title=xyzcba href=#>#xyzcba</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=mystery href=#>#mystery</a> <a title=holloween href=#>#holloween</a> <a title=fypage href=#>#fypage</a> <a title=reels href=#>#reels</a> <a title=odd href=#>#odd</a> <a title=fypシ href=#>#fypシ</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Spencer" href=#>♬ original sound - Spencer</a></figure><p>“The only explanation for this,” he suggests, “is that they all must have girlfriends and just live at their girlfriends’ places because that’s the only thing that makes sense here. I told my friends and family about this and they don’t understand how it’s possible and I don’t really understand how it’s possible either.” Neither do we!</p><p>The question seems to be … Is Spencer sure that he even has roommates? From what we can tell, no one else is living there, and perhaps he can’t get into their bedrooms to see if there’s furniture, clothes, or other belongings. But then, Spencer tells us the craziest story. “One time, I came home, and there were a bunch of people in our living room,” he said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@_spencerhudson</a></figure><p>“They were like, ‘Who are you?’ and I’m like, ‘I live here, who are you?’ And they’re like, ‘We’re waiting for Cole,” and I’m like, ‘Who’s Cole?’ And they’re like, ‘Is this not Cole’s apartment?’ And I had to be like, ‘I’m not really sure because I don’t know the names of my roommates. Maybe this is Cole’s apartment.’ So I just went in my room and waited for them to like, I don’t know, meet up with Cole maybe?”</p><p>Now, the question is… where in the world is Cole? And who is he? Cole seems to be the missing piece of this roommate puzzle, but the puzzle might never be completed. However, people in the comments had something to say about Spencer’s strange, perhaps ghostly, experience.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Commenters shared their own absent roommate experiences and had some otherworldly theories.</h2><p>Maybe it’s just because it’s October, but our spooky senses are heightened. So when someone says they haven’t met their roommates in two months, it’s not that strange to think that maybe Spencer’s roommates are ghosts. A commenter even pointed out, “There are 0 windows… I’m so scared.” We would be, too.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@_spencerhudson</a></figure><p>Someone else jokingly said, “I call my three other personalities ‘roommates’ too.” Of course, we don’t want to make fun of mental illness, but it does add a bit of humor to a very confusing situation. Of course, the scariest possibility? “Maybe you switched dimensions,” someone suggested. Well, we are in the era of the multiverse in media — perhaps there’s some truth to it.</p><p>But mainly, people have a lot of questions. How did Spencer even move in without meeting his roommates? His apartment seems to be a version of campus housing, so it’s likely he didn’t have to meet them to sign a contract or move in. But even knowing that, we’d think that their schedules would overlap at some point.</p><p>They’re all college men — don’t they go out on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights?</p><p>Regardless, we’re now all tuned in to find out if Spencer ever meets his roommates. We are ready for Part 2!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6veceaqqesXaKytXnRqKampZGpsrR5kWakqKakncA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fman-hasnt-met-roommates-2-months.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1524240-nengi-pengi-bbnaija-star-sizzles-steamy-red-ensemble-channels-nicki-minaj-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1524240-nengi-pengi-bbnaija-star-sizzles-steamy-red-ensemble-channels-nicki-minaj-html.html>Nengi Pengi: BBNaija Star Sizzles in Steamy Red Ensemble as She Channels Nicki Minaj</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./know-for-sure-podcast-ending.html>Why Is the Know For Sure Podcast Ending?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./know-for-sure-podcast-ending.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
