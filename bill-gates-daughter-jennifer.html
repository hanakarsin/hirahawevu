His oldest daughter, Jennifer Gates, just got engaged to her boyfriend of two years and the internet is going wild trying to figure out who Bill Gates‚Äô daughter is and if she, too, has an interest in business and technology.</p><p>Jennifer took to Instagram on Jan. 29 to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announce her engagement</u></a> to her boyfriend, Nayel Nassar, and they are adorable together. He posted his own Instagram photos to commemorate the occasion and sang her praises and people are just as curious about who he is. Jennifer and her new fianc√© are definitely going to be the topic of a lot of discussions for the foreseeable future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, who is Bill Gates' daughter Jennifer?</h2><p>At 23 years old, Jennifer is Bill‚Äôs oldest daughter and she is studying to be a doctor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Before that, she went to Stanford, so clearly, education is important to her. She is also an athlete and has competed in different equestrian events over the years. Her life goals, however, involve philanthropy, just like her parents. She told CNN Sports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>she intends to follow in their footsteps</u></a> in some capacity.</p><p>"They‚Äôve inspired me to be a lifetime learner but also inspired me to think about ways to give back,‚Äù she said, of her parents. "I‚Äôm incredibly fortunate to have the resources that I do, so whether that‚Äôs in the equestrian world or in other pursuits, just thinking of ways to help others is a message that I will carry with me forever."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Power outage vibes ‚ÄºÔ∏èüÜòü•µ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jennifer Gates</a> (@jenniferkgates) on Jul 13, 2019 at 7:02pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jennifer and her fianc√© share some common interests.</h2><p>Her social media posts with her Nayel date as far back as 2017, so she had been with him for at least two years before he popped the question. But one of the things that stand out about Jennifer and Nayel is the fact that they share a love for all things equestrian. In her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>post about the engagement</u></a>, Jennifer wrote, "You are one of a kind. Absolutely swept me off my feet this past weekend, surprising me in the most meaningful location over one of our many shared passions."</p><p>Both Jennifer and Nayel are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>riders for the Paris Panthers</u></a> and it has enabled the couple to share their passion while also embarking on sharing the rest of their lives together. It‚Äôs unclear how the sport will factor in Jennifer‚Äôs life as she trudges through medical school, but it has played a part in bringing and keeping Jennifer and Nayel together.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Throwing it back to Sept 2013 when Lordan actually won the Saugerties Million on his first try. Man was that day special. Would have loved to get it done again this year but had to settle for 5th after an unnecessary risk in the jump off. We never stop learning in this sport, and sometimes those lessons are costly, but those are the ones that teach us the most. Wouldn't have it any other way. Thanks Lordan for taking me on this journey.

He‚Äôs a Chicago native, but his parents are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>from Egypt</u></a> and he began riding at the age of five and jumping at 10. He also graduated from Stanford with a degree in Economics and has won a handful of premier jumping competitions.</p><p>Nayel is also just as in love with Jennifer as she is with him. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his Instagram post </u></a>about their engagement, Nayel said, directed toward her, "I can‚Äôt wait to keep growing together through this journey called life, and I simply can‚Äôt imagine mine without you anymore. Love you more than you can possibly imagine, and thank you for making every single day feel like a dream to me."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>All three of my children are fully vaccinated.‚Å£ ‚Å£ Vaccines work.

His other daughter, Phoebe Gates, is just 17 years old and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a student at Julliard</u></a>. Bill‚Äôs son Rory Gates is 20 and although there isn't much known about him compared to his siblings, Bill‚Äôs wife, Melinda Gates, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>referred to Rory</u></a> on Instagram as a "compassionate and curious" feminist.</p><p>As Jennifer starts to plan her wedding, it‚Äôs clear that she has a super supportive family behind her. Honestly, she's definitely going to need it as more people grow curious about who she is. And although she may not be used to so much attention from the public on her alone, Jennifer will probably have to get used to it for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7atuIygmK2do2KxosHGoaueql2fsq%2B6yJ%2Bcqw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbill-gates-daughter-jennifer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./apc-has-been-rigging-osun-since-12-years-ago-atiku.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./apc-has-been-rigging-osun-since-12-years-ago-atiku.html>APC Has Been Rigging Osun Since 12 Years Ago</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./woman-sandals-massage-scam.html>TikToker Says Sandals Charged Her $1,000 More for a Massage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./woman-sandals-massage-scam.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
