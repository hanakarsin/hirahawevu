On May 2, 2023, the WGA went on strike and halted production on major TV and film projects in order to advocate against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers for better pay from streaming residuals as well as protections against infringement from artificial intelligence. It was followed by the <a href=#>SAG-AFTRA strike</a> on July 14 in which Hollywood actors are picketing for similar goals.</p><p>The combined efforts of US writers and actors for better pay and better treatment have resulted in the largest interruption to the US film and television industries since the initial COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. As of this writing, both organizations continue to protest.</p><p>Needless to say, strikes have been on everyone's minds. To that end, folks on <a href=#>TikTok</a> seem convinced that something similar will take place on Sept. 1.

However, the supposed strike doesn't appear to have a concentrated effort. In fact, it's been listed as a "general strike."</p><p>To that end, TikTokers are urging people to do all sorts of seemingly disjointed actions. Prospective participants are being asked not to pay their rent right away, not to buy anything, and to take off from work.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Folks are supposedly protesting things like high rent prices, expensive groceries, and exploitative work environments. People even claim to be gathering at local news stations to... sing in solidarity for the movement?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official page</a>, the strike is not organized by one single organization like the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. This movement is apparently comprised of "a network of people committed to a General Strike to radically change our country."</p><p>As this Sept. 1 strike continues to gain traction, folks are incredibly doubtful about its credibility.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The general strike has raised plenty of red flags on TikTok.</h2><p>While some people are in support of the Sept. 1 movement, many have voiced their concerns about the general strike's lack of direction. @cancelthisclothingcompany performed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breakdown</a> of the strike's official page, wherein the strike seems purposefully vague on things like supporters, funding, and even the overall demands of the strike.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@crutches_and_spice</a> claims that while they are in support of the General Strike, there are still several steps that need to be taken before the appointed date. Several teams and precautions need to be designated in order to pull off a strike as well as support protesters during the movement.</p><p>"These one-day strikes should not be considered one-day strikes," they advise. "They should be considered practice runs [for] making sure you have every single thing in place that you need for the longer strike."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, folks like Jordan (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jordxn.simone</a>) are advising people to flat-out withhold from striking on that date at all. She explains that while she is in support of the movement in general, the steps that need to be taken position Sept. 1 as a wildly unrealistic timeline.</p><p>In her video, she calls the General Strike "poorly planned, poorly executed, and poorly shared," citing the movement's lack of clarity or community safeguards.</p><p>In essence, the entire thought process of a "general strike" being spread on TikTok sounds more like another DashCon waiting to happen. In order for a strike to have an impact, it requires careful planning for a long-haul movement. As of now, many believe that the General Strike is nowhere near prepared enough to tackle that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaPAbr%2FEqauepZKav2590q1kraGbqbys</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happens-september-1st-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./callie-haverda-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./callie-haverda-parents.html>Callie Haverdas Parents Were Hesitant for Her to Act</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./muhammadu-20-buhari.html>Read All The Latest News About Muhammadu Buhari On Naija News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./muhammadu-20-buhari.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
