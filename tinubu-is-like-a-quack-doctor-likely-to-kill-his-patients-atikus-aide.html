<time>23 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bola-Tinubu-thinking.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2><a href=#>Phrank Shaibu</a>, the Special Assistant on Public Communications to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, has issued a stern warning about the potential impacts of President Bola Tinubu’s policies on Nigeria’s population.</h2><p>In a statement released in Abuja on Thursday, Shaibu expressed grave concerns, stating that if hunger does not decimate Nigeria’s population, President Tinubu’s “shambolic policies” certainly will.</p><p>Shaibu’s criticism comes amidst growing dissatisfaction with the current administration’s handling of economic and social policies.</p><p>He argued that the policies implemented by President Tinubu and the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration are having devastating effects on the Nigerian populace, with little to no efforts being made to mitigate these adverse outcomes.</p><p>Shaibu said, “The unprecedented hunger, poverty, and hardship in Nigeria are part of Tinubu’s ultimate plan to decimate Nigerians and pauperise them until they have no shred of dignity left.</p><p>“Tinubu is like a quack doctor trying to treat a cancerous patient. But the quack doctor is likely to kill the patient even faster than the cancer itself. This is the dire situation that Nigerians have found themselves in.</p><p>“Rather than get to work, he continues to blame his predecessor, President Muhammadu Buhari, for handing him an empty treasury and a weak economy and the opposition for instigating mass protests. He talks as if Buhari was not a member of their diseased All Progressives Congress. He also forgets that his own kabukabu policies and its fallouts are what is instigating the mass protests across the country.”</p><p>Atiku aide further noted that on Tinubu’s watch, poverty has reached an all-time high, with food inflation at 33%.</p><p>He noted that the resulting effect would be a drop in unemployment, a rise in suicide levels, an increase in crime as well as a spike in the number of out-of-school children.</p><p>According to him, operators in the private sector of the economy continue to complain about how the Tinubu administration has led them into uncertain times, resulting in about 10 million small and micro businesses being closed.</p><p>He further stated that the free fall in the exchange rate and haphazard nature of government policies under Tinubu’s administration have made a rubbish of projections made by businesses during the last quarter of 2023.</p><p>Shaibu equally noted that in the past, garri and beans were considered food for the poor but even today, the poor cannot afford to buy beans which now costs ₦1,500 per mudu and with no prospects of a stop in the rising prices. SMA baby formula now costs ₦8,000 from ₦2,200.</p><p>He said, “Just over a year ago, a 50kg bag of rice was N47,000, but today it is N77,000. Beans used to be N36,000, but now it is N42,000. Bread was N700 for a loaf, but now it sells for ₦1,200. A single egg now costs N150. Imagine how much a crate costs? Even the agbado corn that Tinubu used in campaigning is also expected to go up by over 25%, according to AFEX.</p><p>“The tragedy now is that a vast majority of Nigerians whose means can’t afford decent meals, unfortunately contend with staples meant for animals.</p><p>“A recent BBC investigative report says that many people consume rejected rice gains by millers. The report specifically says that those rejected grains are purchased by fish farmers to feed their fisheries.</p><p>“In a similar context, a random visit to the Garki Market in Abuja will behold a large number of people queuing for maize shafts which they now turn into solid food. Normally, these shafts are sold to livestock farmers, but now Nigerians resort to these forms of staple as human food.”</p><p>To underscore how dire the situation has become, he quoted the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Lagos, as saying in December that the hospital recorded a 100% increase in the number of psychiatric patients admitted in the hospital.</p><p>Shaibu added that, “Just last month, a female banker committed suicide inside the banking hall, claiming that the economic hardship is unbearable. Indeed, as it is stated in Proverbs 29, verse 2: When the righteous rule, the people rejoice. But when the wicked rule, the people suffer. That is Nigeria’s current quagmire where life is brutish, short and nasty and kidnappers have taken over the land.</p><p>“When the Nigeria Economic Summit Group asked him last year to explain how he would pull out over 128 million Nigerians out of the poverty that his political party, the APC, had plunged them into, Tinubu responded by saying that he would not reveal his strategy because he didn’t want the other candidates to steal his plan. But his secret plan has now been revealed, which is to pauperise and decimate Nigerians.</p><p>“This was a man who advised the government in 2021 to recruit 50 million youths into the Nigerian Army in order to tackle unemployment. His balabu economic prescriptions have gradually brought Nigeria to its knees, putting the Naira as the worst performing currency in Africa, according to Bloomberg. This is just less than one year in office.</p><p>“After removing petrol subsidy abruptly and forcing the CBN to float the currency, he promised to provide succour to Nigerians and then went ahead to approve N3bn to review the social register. Monies meant for poor Nigerians were stolen by his appointees.</p><p>“A separate N40bn meant for poor Nigerians was diverted. His interior minister, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, whose company got a questionable contract from this humanitarian fund, is still keeping his job.</p><p>“This President then suspended all humanitarian programmes amid this hardship under the guise of investigation.</p><p>“It is obvious that Tinubu’s ultimate goal is to transform Africa’s largest economy into a land of sweat and tears. Worse still, his so-called plan to convert CNG Buses and reduce the cost of transportation has also failed after appointing the FIRS Chairman, Zaccheus Adedeji, as Chairman of the committee. This is another example of putting loyalty ahead of competence.”</p><p>Atiku’s aide further said Tinubu’s perspective on economy had been limited by the fact that he had surrounded himself with his Lagos circle and had put loyalty ahead of competence in his appointment process.</p><p>He argued that at least half of Tinubu’s cabinet members ought not to have been appointed in the first place but that the President decided to play politics, playing fiddle while Nigeria burnt.</p><p>Shaibu also said, “At a time Nigeria was facing its worst fiscal crisis, this man decided to waste the country’s resources by appointing the largest cabinet in the history of Nigeria with 48 ministers even though 36 ministers would have met the constitutional threshold. Many of these ministers have been seat warmers and have achieved nothing in the last six months.</p><p>“Some ministries were split into three, and three ministers were appointed to head each new unit. Even though Nigeria’s revenue shrunk, he decided to buy a yacht, renovate the Presidential Villa and that of the Vice President, sent a delegation of hundreds of people to Dubai for the COP28, and then approved over N120bn for SUVs for National Assembly members in order to win their loyalty over.</p><p>“He was doing all these while asking Nigerians to endure and sacrifice. At least even his own personal praise singer, King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal (KWAM 1), is now among those lamenting that the suffering is too much. He should be patient, Tinubu still has three years and three months to increase the poverty level.”</p><p>Atiku’s aide said Tinubu clearly knew little about Nigeria’s economy as he had been limited only to Lagos, which had always had a formal economy.</p><p>He said the President knew nothing about security or building a national economy, hence his over-reliance on IMF and other multilateral organisations.</p><p>Shaibu said, “Tinubu rode to power on the lie that he transformed Lagos economy. The truth is that Lagos had been the country’s commercial capital even before he was born. All banks, telecommunications firms, and oil companies are headquartered in Lagos. About 70% of Lagos’ revenue comes from income tax paid by staff of these companies.</p><p>“All Tinubu did was to enforce tax payment which the military government had neglected. This was the financial miracle he claimed to have performed. Now, he has been brought to the national level to repeat the so-called miracle, but the failed magician cannot rework his artistry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BuZq2hnqqvtnnIrGSloZuaeqJ50K6YnKNdmbykwM6rZKWhm5q5unnTqGSkoZyheqm10manmqyZmru1v4yaq6Kjpah6orXDnmY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftinubu-is-like-a-quack-doctor-likely-to-kill-his-patients-atikus-aide.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./adam-sevani-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./adam-sevani-html.html>Adam G.
