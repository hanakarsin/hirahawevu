While the 30-year-old musician announced the release of his next album, "No Pressure," which will officially drop on July 24, he also announced that he would be retiring from the music industry entirely to be the best father he could possibly be.</p><p>Although the news of Logic's career ending came as quite a shock to many, fans are seriously thrilled for the Maryland-based musician and his new family. Stay tuned for everything you need to know regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic's baby mama</a> and his newborn son.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Logic and his now-wife announced they were expecting last summer.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logic met Brittney Noell at the beginning of 2018</a>, shortly after splitting from his ex-wife, Jessica Andrea. According to TMZ, they made their first public appearance together on a private jet to one of his shows in April 2018, and although Logic and Brittney didn't announce their engagement, fans got the hint when she appeared to be celebrating with a bachelorette party in San Diego in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Brittney and Logic ended up applying for a marriage license a month later in July 2019, which was around the same time they announced Brittney was pregnant. They tied the knot shortly after, and although we haven't yet found any photos from the wedding, we're guessing it was relatively low-key, with both of them looking seriously incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Logic, Brittney isn't a musician, but she seems to do quite well for herself nonetheless. She has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own clothing line</a> and recently released a new collection called the B&W collection, and she is also a talented model. Needless to say, Brittney and Logic are adorable together, and it seems as though they're seriously crazy about each other.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's what we know about Logic and Brittney's newborn son:</h2><p>Logic and Brittney generally like to keep things private, but on Friday, July 17, Logic took to Instagram to open up about his newborn son, whom they call LB, or "Little Bobby."</p><p>"Privacy with family is something that is very important to me me. However my fans have been my family since this all started so I wanted to share with you a glimpse into the life I am now diving into head first. I would like you to meet LB as we call him, Little Bobby," he said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in the Instagram post.</a></p><p>Fans assumed Logic would name his son Bobby, according to Extra, after he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singing the line:</a> "Welcome little Bobby to the world" in his 2019 song, "No Pressure." Logic and Brittney named their son little Bobby, because Robert is Logic's father's name.&nbsp;</p><p>Logic also announced the gender of their baby boy in “No Pressure,” with the lyric, “Surprise! It’s a little baby boy, f**k TMZ, they can’t get the scoop on that sh*t!” Needless to say, we completely understand why he decided to retire.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Privacy with family is something that is very important to me me.

These two make me the happiest man in the world and it’s a happiness nothing else has ever been able to fulfill. I know the news of retirement may be bittersweet when understanding the motives behind it. But worry not dear listener. I will still be here for you. This will now if anything only allow me to focus more on not only my family. But YOU! My family reading this. Without the stress of this industry we can communicate more.&nbsp;Interact more, and I’m so excited for that. I love you and thank you so so much for being here with me all these years.
