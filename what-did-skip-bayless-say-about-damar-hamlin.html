However, his disgusting comments regarding Buffalo Bills safety <a href=#>Damar Hamlin</a> and his life-threatening injury are, without a doubt, the worst of his entire career.</p><p>Following the pro athlete's terrifying injury that forced the team's <a href=#>Monday Night Football</a> game against the <a href=#>Cincinnati Bengals</a> to be postponed, Skip took to Twitter and shared one of the most horrendous sports takes ever. As expected, his insensitive and compassionless tweet resulted in immense backlash.</p><p>So, what did Skip say about Damar Hamlin?

The latest health update indicates the 24-year-old professional athlete is in critical condition.</p><p>Many took to social media to share prayers and support, but Skip Bayless had other plans and made a tweet that has been widely described as insensitive: "No doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of this game — but how? This late in the season, a game of this magnitude is crucial to the regular-season outcome ... which suddenly seems so irrelevant."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>No doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of this game - but how?

As a result, he faced immediate backlash from his followers, including high-profile sports figures such as former quarterback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Griffin III</a>, former wide receiver <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dez Bryant</a>, and former cornerback <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darrelle Revis</a>.</p><p>Nearly an hour later, Skip attempted to clarify his tweet with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up message</a>: "Nothing is more important than that young man's health. That was the point of my last tweet. I'm sorry if that was misunderstood but his health is all that matters. Again, everything else is irrelevant. I prayed for him and will continue to."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Skip addressed his insensitive tweet on 'Undisputed.'</h2><p>On the Jan. 3 episode of <a href=#>Undisputed</a> (which co-host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Sharpe</a> was noticeably absent from), the 71-year-old sports commentator said he believed his offensive tweet was "widely misconstrued or misinterpreted."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>With papers shaking in his hand Skip Bayless does not apologize for his tweet he sent as Damar Hamlin fights for his life after going into cardiac arrest after making a football tackle.

"I was putting myself in the heads of the NFL executives, starting with Roger Goodell, who were having to figure out on the fly what to do here. And I stated the glaringly obvious which is that no doubt the NFL is considering postponing the rest of the game."</p><p>"This is right in the middle of the vortex of this situation when it was unclear what they were going to do with the game," Skip continued. "But I made the point that this late in the season, but with a game of this magnitude, it's very difficult to postpone it. Yet, the end of my tweet was 'all of which suddenly seems so irrelevant.' For the first time in the history of the NFL, my point was, it was all rendered irrelevant by what was happening on the football field."</p><p>"Nothing is more important than that young man's health. That was the point," Skip emphasized yet again. "I'm sorry if that was misunderstood, but his health is all that matters. Again, everything else is irrelevant. ... If you're offended by that, God bless you. I get it. Maybe there’s a part of me that's somewhat offended by it. But this is our job."</p><p style=text-align:start>Our thoughts are with Damar’s friends, family, and teammates during this challenging time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lo6C2sXnBmrClnaOoerSt2GaYm6elqXqlrcyaqWagkaK5qro%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-did-skip-bayless-say-about-damar-hamlin.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alix-earle-siblings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alix-earle-siblings.html>TikTok Influencer Alix Earle Has Five Siblings Details</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sara-gilbert-html.html>Sara Gilbert - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sara-gilbert-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
