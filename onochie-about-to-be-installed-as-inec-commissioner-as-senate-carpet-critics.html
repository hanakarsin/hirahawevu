Onochie admitted being part of Buhari’s campaign organisation in 2015 before she was appointed Special Assistant on Social Media.</p><p>She also admitted deposing an affidavit at the Abuja Federal High Court that she was a member of the&nbsp; APC. She, however, noted that she stopped being a member of the party immediately after the 2019 elections.</p><p>She said, “Since 2019, I have not had anything to do with any political organisation, including Buhari support groups.</p><p>“When the APC was doing re-validation of party members, I did not take part in that exercise.</p><p>“As I’m sitting down here, I’m not a member of any political party in this country. I have no partisanship in my blood.</p><p>“I have seen many petitions against my nomination not only from the Peoples Democratic Party but also from some APC members.</p><p>“I’m not partisan, they know. It is about the law. No one has any reason to fear for my nomination as INEC commissioner representing Delta.</p><p>“As far as I’m concerned, I’m madam due process. That’s why all the attacks. I follow due process, I follow the law.”</p><p>Her speech generated a barrage of reactions with oppositions calling for her name to be ruled out of the screening.</p><p>Naija News understands that an affidavit dated 30th June 2021, swore to at an FCT High Court, attached to one of the petitions against her, contradicted Onochie’s claims.</p><p>She deposed to the affidavit at the High Court of the FCT in a case involving her as plaintiff an Emeka Ugwuonye (defendant).</p><p>Onochie in her witness statement on oat affirmed among others that, “I am also a member of the All Progressives Congress and a volunteer at the Buhari Support Organisation.”</p><p>She further told the panel that Mrs May Agbamuche, a serving INEC national commissioner from Delta State, is representing Cross River on the board of the electoral umpire.</p><p>There was a sharp disagreement among the senators on whether Onochie should say the denial on oath or not but Gaya ruled that she didn’t need to do so and subsequently adjourned the proceedings.</p><p>Reports emerging, however, asserted that Onochie could be declared as INEC commissioner as the panel paid deaf ears to criticism of the presidential aide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BpZqimn5i1qrGMmpmoraRiwbB5wZ5koqajqa6tuMSdZJqrXZ67pq%2BMnKampZmowKq7zZ6pZpmjYsCmusCtnGabkae9psCMnKmirJmYwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fonochie-about-to-be-installed-as-inec-commissioner-as-senate-carpet-critics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dwts-season-30-cast.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dwts-season-30-cast.html>The 'DWTS' Season 30 Cast Includes a Former 'Bachelor' and a Few Influencers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./matt-terry-html.html>Matt Terry - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./matt-terry-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
