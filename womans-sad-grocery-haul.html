Protest like in the ’60s and '70s!"</p><p>There was one user, however, who said that folks can still afford groceries for less money, they just needed to be willing to put in a bit of leg work and frequent services/stores that are outside the realm of traditional retail experiences by utilizing a service called "barn2door" which connects consumers directly to local farmers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @neverblue1978</span></figure><p>"www.barn2door.com and your local farmers. there are cheaper better ways," they penned.</p><p>According to the Barn2door website, folks will be able to "access real-time farm inventory" with the service, meaning that they're only going to be getting offered fresh meat and produce which are dictated by seasonal availability.</p><p>But how do its prices compare? Well, let's juxtapose the cost of an entire fresh cut of cow's brisket from Apple Ridge Farm in NJ, as compared to a whole brisket from a Walmart's meat department in NJ. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Ridge sells the cut for $41.52</a>, whereas Walmart sells it for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$55.44</a>.</p><p>However, a dozen eggs at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Ridge are $8</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whereas Walmart sells 36 for $4.32 online</a>. There are other factors to consider when using a service like Barn2Door that connects you with local farmers, and it may be in a shopper's best interest to directly communicate with these farms to see if they can work out deals with you for direct purchases of their goods.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @neverblue1978</span></figure><p>But there are also plenty of local farmer's markets that folks can often visit in order to buy larger quantities of food for less money. Sure, they don't offer some of the same amenities as popular retail chains, and the items patrons will be able to select may ultimately be limited to whatever is available at the time.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Penny Hoarder</a> writes that grocery shoppers can save big if they decide to buy produce/goods when they're at the "peak" of their respective seasons. One of the top ways that the outlet suggests people end up saving money, however, is to never go to the farmer's market with the expectation of getting a specific thing.</p><p>Basically, folks are going to have to get what they get and not get upset and base their meals around whatever is available at the moment for a good price.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @neverblue1978</span></figure><p>But there's another reason why shoppers are experiencing so much grief at the grocery store checkout counter, and many people believe it has to do with policies implemented by the current Presidential administration.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hill</a> has reported a positive correlation between the increase in grocery item costs along the surge in SNAP funding, which means that those who receive "food stamp" benefits aren't getting more bang for their buck, and shoppers who aren't on subsidized assistance are spending more for their goods than ever before.</p><p>Regardless of the factors at play, it looks like it'll be a tough year for many around the globe as governments try to cool off inflation and avoid pushing further into a global recession.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc2sZKyZlGK0s7vCnqmyZZiWwq0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwomans-sad-grocery-haul.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./super-eagles-legend-sunday-oliseh-speaks-on-returning-to-manage-super-eagles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./super-eagles-legend-sunday-oliseh-speaks-on-returning-to-manage-super-eagles.html>Super Eagles Legend, Sunday Oliseh Speaks On Returning To Manage Super Eagles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./70304-html.html>Lawyer Bamidele Aturu Was Laid To Rest In Ondo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./70304-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
