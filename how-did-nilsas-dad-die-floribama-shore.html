Gus Smyrnios was sporting a thick and lush head of hair, <a href=#><u>Nilsa Prowant</u></a> was pregnant, and neither of them had any plans to hook up, as they had done for nearly every other season of the show thus far. It is the beginning of a new dawn and, honestly, it may be for the best.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another thing Nilsa announced at the start of the season was that, prior to filming, her dad died. And, although she has been open about it on the show and on social media, some Floribama Shore fans are curious about how he died. It was an unexpected loss for the family and it's one that was still quite raw for Nilsa when she left home to film with her roommates again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did Nilsa's dad die on 'Floribama Shore'?</h2><p>Nilsa explained on the show that her dad collapsed on the floor suddenly in August 2020 and was rushed to the hospital. Shortly after, Nilsa and her family had to make the decision to have him resuscitated. She hasn't revealed any other details surrounding his death, but it's possible it was related to a heart attack or some other underlying issue he may not have even been aware of.</p><p>"My father went to be with the Lord Thursday night," Nilsa wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>, following her father's death. "He was a God-fearing man, I am confident knowing the Lord gave him his wings and now he is my guardian angel. He lived a good life and was so proud of what he had accomplished. The world lost a good one, no, a great one. He did everything for us kids and my mom for us to live the best life possible."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nilsa comes from a very tight-knit family.</h2><p>Nilsa's parents were together for 30 years before his sudden death. She has a brother and sister who were also extremely close to their father. In Nilsa's heartfelt Instagram post announcing the tragedy, Nilsa shared stories about her dad, which included him building a house for her mother and opening up a beauty pageant store so she and her sister could participate in pageants as kids.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 4 of 'Floribama Shore' was a different experience for her.</h2><p>Not only did Nilsa leave home to film Floribama Shore Season 4 not too long after her father's death, but she did so while being pregnant. It meant the season would be harder than ever for her, especially because she was away from family, friends, and her boyfriend, the father of her baby. Nilsa opened up to Us Weekly about the difficulties of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>filming the show sober</u></a>. And, as to be expected, it was a different experience.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Nilsa explained that it was hard at times, especially because she had already gone through so much before she agreed to go on vacation with her co-stars. But, she added, it actually helped prepare her for motherhood.</p><p>"I need to be grateful because filming this time around, while pregnant, really prepared me for motherhood," she told the outlet. "It's like I had six drunk kids at all times. I gotta make sure they stay alive."</p><p>Watch Floribama Shore on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2ammaHAor%2BMnZidZZSesm6yy6ipopqRoq5uv8eoqZ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-nilsas-dad-die-floribama-shore.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./aboki-rate-latest-us-dollar-to-naira-black-market-rates-today-13th-september-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./aboki-rate-latest-us-dollar-to-naira-black-market-rates-today-13th-september-2022.html>Latest US Dollar To Naira Black Market Rates Today, 13th September 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./do-contestants-on-supermarket-sweep-keep-the-groceries.html>Heres What Happens to the Groceries on Supermarket Sweep</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./do-contestants-on-supermarket-sweep-keep-the-groceries.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
