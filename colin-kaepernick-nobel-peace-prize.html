More than two weeks after <a href=#>George Floyd</a> was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer — who knelt on the Black man's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds as he laid face-down on the ground, pleading that he couldn't breathe and begging for his mama — worldwide protests are ongoing. And finally, some actual change is starting to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Colin's kneeling was seriously misunderstood at the time, people have come to realize that his peaceful protest sparked a much larger movement than even he knew at the time.

Whoopi Goldberg had asked Sunny if the former NFL player was owed an apology — considering he was not signed with a team after his police brutality demonstrations.</p><p>"I think he's not only owed an apology, Whoopi.

It really just is shameful," she explained. "I'm sort of shocked that Roger Goodell never mentioned his name."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We, the NFL, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black People.
