However, it's a realistic piece of fiction that focuses on a mother seeking revenge for the hit-and-run death of her 6-year-old son.</p><p>The series has been based off of a 1938 novel written by Nicholas Blake (not the author's real name). British screenwriter Gaby Chiappe adapted the story into a five-episode miniseries that follows the film's protagonist, who poses as a novelist in order to "get in" with the family of the person she believes murdered her son in the hit-and-run accident.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: AMC</a></figure><p>The series differentiates from the novel in some key ways: Blake's novel tells the story of Frank Cairns, a crime writer who plans to kill the hit-and-run driver who murdered his young son. However, when the subject of his ire turns up dead, Frank becomes the prime suspect for a murder that he intended to commit, but never got the chance to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cush Jumbo's character in The Beast Must Die looked oddly familiar somehow until I realized today that she sort of resembles Kathy Acker <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZVeik8nScD</a></p>— Isambard Findom Brunel (@LCvonHessen) <a href=#>July 3, 2021</a></figure><p>Cairns' old pal, Nigel Strangeways, is brought in to solve the mystery, and the plot devolves into a labyrinthine murder mystery full of twists and turns that was heralded as one of The Observer's 1,000 novels everyone must read.</p><p>The book has spawned several film adaptations: a 1969 French movie and a 1952 Argentinian film. There's a 1974 movie of the same name, but that's actually based on a James Blish story, not the Blake narrative.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Finished the 5-episode The Beast Must Die last night after the chaos of the football.
