He declared his presidency with or without BBI and he's still on the ticket. BBI has nothing to do with his candidacy. It has nothing to do with Uhuru continuing his term because their is no clause in it saying the incumbent president continues his term. It is all propaganda," he said.<p class=align-left>The president said he firmly believed in uniting the country and part of that was by having more leadership positions as proposed in the now-moribund BBI document.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3c9f638da8bb136a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Newspapers Review for August 25: Gloves Off as Uhuru, Ruto Take on Each Other over Resignation, BBI Ruling</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He also clarified that his meetings with National Super Alliance principals had nothing to do with succession <a href=#>politics</a>, further stating why Ruto was excluded from the BBI process.</p>"He ( Ruto) has been opposed to the (BBI) process.
