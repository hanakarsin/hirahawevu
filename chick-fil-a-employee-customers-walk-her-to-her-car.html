She delved into the specifics of her situation: "Let me tell y'all why I'm hiding in the bathroom right now. So, we're closed, and we're doing our closing tasks before we get ready to go home."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @destini.j</span></figure><p>She continued, "Earlier today while I was at work, this police officer came in and he was like talking to me but I didn't pay no attention to it. When it was time for him to leave he's like what time do you get off work? I was like ten o'clock. He was like OK bet I'm gonna be here in my police car I'll walk you to your car."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Des didn't seem like she was too thrilled by this proposal, "OK big man, all right, couple of hours later, another guy comes in, completely different aesthetic, completely different type of man, he comes in he talks to me...I give him his food he's like what time do you get off? But he said it in a way like oh you seem like you been at work all day, what time do you get off?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Again, she told the second customer, "Oh, ten o'clock cause, why would I lie? And he's like, I'll be here to walk you to your car. What? No, cause somebody else was trying...it's too much. It's too much, in the same day, it's too much...and now I'm hiding."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Several TikTokers in the comments section began relaying their own tales of pushy customers who attempt to spend time with them after their shift is over at work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Others said that they too have felt the need to come up with creative ways within conversations to try and let people down easy without upsetting them, while others said that putting someone in the position to do that is a terrible personality trait for someone to have.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And then there were those who wished that individuals would be more considerate when it came to talking with employees on the job and confusing their kindness for potential romantic interest, as most folks who are on the clock are just concerned with getting their work done for the day and then going home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, many TikTokers wanted to know what ultimately happened when she finally left the bathroom to go home.

At least I don't think he showed up, so cop for the win."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: TikTok | @destini.j</span></figure><p>What do you think?
