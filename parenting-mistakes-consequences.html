It's probably a small comfort to know you're not alone — even the most supportive and well-meaning parents will at some point do something to put their kids in therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble is, it's often the small mistakes that barely register. In a recent Ask Reddit thread, users named some of the parenting mistakes that seem inconsequential but can lead to major problems down the road.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Being too attentive</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Nobody's suggesting you should completely ignore your kids, but it can be just as bad to make them your whole world, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBianco87</u></a> whose mom "quit having her own life the moment my brother and I were born." While she was seemingly the ideal mother, not having her own interests and friendships made her focus far too much on her kids' performance in every aspect of life. Eventually, DBianco87 felt so smothered, they were driven to enlist just to get some distance. "To this day I often feel like I'm a bad person who failed to live up to her love," they say.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Good-natured teasing</h2><p>It's good to develop an ability to take a joke at one's own expense, but you don't want to start too early, and you should definitely be aware that kids are super sensitive. "I found that when my parents teased me about stuff I was clearly uncomfortable with, it made me tell them less later in life," said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>relishinabub</u></a>. While they have a good relationship with their parents it's not very open due to their tendency to tease.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not apologizing</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: GIPHY</span></figure><p>You may think admitting when you're wrong will undermine your authority with your kids, but it actually can mean your kids don't have a healthy model for how to apologize — and they may have trouble admitting to their wrongs as they grow up. "It’s built up such a resentment for her over the years, and I also have trouble saying sorry myself because of it," says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>skeletonfather</u></a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not stopping when your kids say "stop"</h2><p>"Whether it's teasing, or tickling, or wresting," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>OfficeChairHero</u></a> says, always listen when your kids put up boundaries. "Kids who have parents that don't respect their boundaries always seem to end up being the biggest ... bullies because they've learned they don't have to respect other people's feelings."</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not following through on a promise</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Parents sometimes make promises figuring their kids will forget and back down on them, but it can hamper their trust in you. "If you told your child you were buying ice cream tomorrow in the hopes that they'd forget and the next day when they ask you tell them no they'll see you as unreliable," says &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A_H_Corvus</a>. Same goes for consistently forgetting to pick your kid up. Plenty readers agreed that not being able to count on their parents' word created huge trust issues for them as adults.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Belittling their interests</h2><p>Look, kids can be annoying. They have a tendency to have obsessions that can get really trying, but you want to be careful not to unintentionally quash your kids' passions with disinterest or annoyance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>bunnyrut</u></a> says, "I used to love to sing. I was in chorus and would play my favorite songs over and over to learn the words." But the keywords are "used to." Unfortunately, their parents told them to knock it off all the time, so they retreated and stopped singing altogether.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Getting a laugh at your kid's expense.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NBC New York (@nbcnewyork)</a> on Mar 5, 2019 at 7:33am PST</p></figure><p>This is one to definitely be careful of in the age of social media. You may go viral with a hilarious video of your kid doing something embarrassing, but are all the likes and shares worth the damage to your kid? One user remarked, "Often times our parents are our first bullies," which is so true.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Never letting them lose</h2><p>"We love our kids and want them to feel special, but it's setting them up to be disappointed later in life when they find out not everyone can win," says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>supersonic-hedgehog</u></a>. &nbsp;"Let them feel the disappointments early on, and teach them it's OK. They'll grow up better able to handle the stresses of life."</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Telling kids not to cry</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p><u>User </u><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>potatobug25</u></a> says their parent would treat crying as something only weak people do, and a lot of parents do this — they tell kids to "be a big boy / girl" and dry up. But this can make kids feel a lot of shame over their emotions and grow up with an inability to express themselves in healthy ways.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Forcing physical affection</h2><p>Most adults can remember at least one time they were forced to endure a kiss or hug from a relative or acquaintance even though they didn't want to. Unfortunately, we're now learning that this is a way of ignoring your child's body autonomy, and it can make it harder for them to know when their boundaries are being transgressed in far more harmful ways as they get older.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Making kids "clean their plate"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Kids can be picky eaters and getting them to eat is sometimes a struggle. However, forcing them to each past the point they feel finished can create life-long food issues. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>radiolesscar</u></a> puts it, this "causes your child to associate a feeling of guilt with not finishing their food and, possibly, food in general, which can further contribute to problematic eating behaviors.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Snooping through their stuff</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Older generations were brought up to think they had no expectation of privacy under their parents' roofs, but it's important to let your children have their secrets. A user on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> says their mom's constant rooting through their trash and drawers as a kid was so normalized for her that she found herself doing it with partners in her adult relationships because "It just didn't strike me as wrong." Everyone deserves to have privacy, even kids.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"I don't care who started it."</h2><p>Kids fight with their siblings and it's trying as heck, but you should never shut down a discussion about who "started it." It sends the message that justice isn't as important as keeping the peace, and as many commenters pointed out, it can lead to messed up ideas about who is to blame in violent situations.</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not giving them chores.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>You might think it's doing your kids a favor to not give them chores. You might think wanting them to focus on their activities and academics is setting them up for success. The result, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>xkombatxwombatx</u></a>? "When I moved out to uni I didn’t really know how to clean, when to clean, what to clean with, how to wash clothes, how to get them dry etc. The only thing I could do is cook and binge drink." Not a recipe for success, and it's honestly remarkable they even learned to cook!</p>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Choosing their friends for them</h2><p>Your kids are going to have some toxic friends at some point in their lives, but you have to "let them figure out who’s bad and who’s good on their own," asserts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>RyanArmstrong777</u></a>. How will they know how to spot red flags without practice? You can provide counsel, but it's rarely a good idea to outright forbid your kids from hanging out with someone.</p><p>Also, parents may operate under their biases when deciding which kids are acceptable companions — and they're often wrong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6zsc2toKefXaK2tMDApJysZZOku7Sx0K6cp5uVqA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fparenting-mistakes-consequences.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./maximilien-derobespierre-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./maximilien-derobespierre-html.html>Maximilien De Robespierre - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sai-de-silva-html.html>Sai De Silva - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sai-de-silva-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
