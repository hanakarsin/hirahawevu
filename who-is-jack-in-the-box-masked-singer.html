The April 20 episode revealed the man behind the mask, and many knew it was him all along.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: Jack in the Box has been revealed! Scroll down to find out who was behind the mask!</strong></p><p>The competition is fierce in Season 7 of <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>, and many contestants have already been unmasked. However, there are still a few more costumed participants to figure out, and they aren't giving the judges an easy time. This season, characters have been sorted into three groups: The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly.</p><p>Team Bad is full of unique characters, but one, in particular, has fans wanting to know more. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack in the Box</a> has been notably absent from previews or the intro, making fans wonder if the person under the mask is not popular in the public eye. Read on for more info — including clues about Jack in the Box's identity and our best guesses for who was behind the mask before his reveal.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jack in the Box on 'The Masked Singer' — The Clues</h2><p>There were very limited clues about Jack in the Box available until his episode aired on April 20. Leading up to the show, most of what we had to go on was just his costume:</p><ul><li>The costume headpiece looked like a rooster or a chicken with bright fabric in orange, purple, yellow, and green.</li><li>The headpiece also had an upside-down triangle on the forehead.</li><li>The bottom half of the costume was a bright green box with a question mark.</li><li>The costume wasn't very mobile, so the person behind the mask was likely not a dancer.</li></ul><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Many fans suspected there was a reason The Masked Singer was being so secretive about the Jack in the Box costume in particular. Before Season 7 of the show premiered, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> announced in February 2022 that former President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, would participate in The Masked Singer, much to the distress of many viewers and several judges on the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jack in the Box on 'The Masked Singer' — The Guesses</h2><p>Due to the mystery around the character, there could have been many famous people who volunteered for the Jack in the Box mask. However, many fans suspected that, due to a lack of promotional material for Jack in the Box, the person under the mask was <a href=#>Rudy Giuliani</a>. The lack of promotion for the character was most likely due to the extreme backlash producers faced once Deadline had reported Giuliani would be on the show.</p><p>However, some fans thought that maybe it was all a ploy to take the attention away from Rudy Giuliani in order to surprise audiences with someone truly unexpected. Given that, some fans threw around other names for who could be under the Jack in the Box mask, including:</p><ul><li>Jack Black</li><li>Alec Baldwin</li><li>Seth Rogan</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Jack in the Box on 'The Masked Singer'? The answer is... Rudy Giuliani.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span><p>Rudy Giuliani revealed to be Jack in the Box</p></figure><p>Fans were definitely right this time. After getting voted off the show, Jack in the Box was revealed to be former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. As previously reported, not everyone was happy to see Trump's personal attorney. Both Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke walked off the stage when he was revealed.</p><p>Fans took to Twitter to share their thoughts on what happened and as expected, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opinions were divided</a>. Some fans applauded Ken and Robin for taking a stand, while shaming Fox for even allowing Giuliani to appear on the show at all. Others criticized the walk-off as "unprofessional," saying that shows like The Masked Singer should just keep politics out of it altogether.</p><p>Tune in to see more reveals when new episodes of The Masked Singer air on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOZk6B6qrqMrZ%2BeZZKkxW65wKyinpxdqLavs8Sr</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jack-in-the-box-masked-singer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-jordan-chiles-score-change.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-jordan-chiles-score-change.html>Why Did Jordan Chiles's Score Change at the Olympics?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-gordon-ramsay.html>What Happened to Gordon Ramsay?
