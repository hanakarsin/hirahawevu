AnnaLynne McCord’s <a href=#>family</a> comprises her two parents and siblings. She is the second born to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">David McCord</a> and Shari McCord. Her two siblings are Rachel McCord and Angel McCord, who also happen to be actresses.</p><p class=align-left>Their father is a pastor, and their mother stayed at home to help AnnaLynne with school work. AnnaLynne’s mother, Shari McCord, homeschooled her throughout her <a href=#>education</a> until she graduated high school at 15 years.</p><p class=align-left>However, she did not continue with her higher education and instead pursued her passion for modelling. In pursuing modelling, she joined a drama school in New York while she was 17 to cast her net into acting.</p><h2>Relationships</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7935c285220d52ae.jpeg><p class=align-left>AnnaLynne has only committed to two <a href=#>relationships</a> in her life. She has dated Kellan Lutz and Dominic Purcell but was rumoured to have had a thing with Aaron O'Connell, Julian Edelman and Rick Fox.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3b13eb1394574ac8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Reef Neeman biography: What you should know about the Faunda actress</span></p></a><p class=align-left>AnnaLynne McCord’s first serious relationship was with co-star Kellan Lutz. They were both acting for 90210 and decided to hit it off in September 2008. The couple stayed together for two years and had a brief break up in 2010.</p><p class=align-left>AnnaLynne and Kellan<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> rekindled their relationship</a> in 2011, but it didn’t work out since they were both busy and focused on work. They broke up in the summer of 2011. McCord got romantically involved with Dominic Purcell in 2011. Their relationship is the perfect definition of an on and off kind of relationship since they have broken up two times and are now together for the third time.</p><p class=align-left>AnnaLynne McCord and Dominic Purcell enjoyed three years of their relationship before announcing their first break up in 2014. After a year, they were back together after Dominic had been diagnosed with skin cancer. Initially, she was back as a friend, but their solid romantic connection could not allow. So, they ended updating again.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b4c620763443508a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trinidad Valentin: nationality, Saweetie, family, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2018, AnnaLynne ended the relationship, and the two went on their separate ways. Interestingly, their ways met once again, and in 2020, they were spotted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on vacation together</a> at Huntington Beach. Despite having a long-standing romantic connection with Dominic Purcell, AnnaLynne is not married and has never been married to him.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>It was difficult for AnnaLynne McCord to walk into her passion for modelling and acting since she was from a religious family. Her father was strict and would not allow her to do things like modelling despite being AnnaLynne's passion. She considered her relationship with her parents to be toxic, and by the time she was 15, she had plans of going out on her own.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating from high school, she went to Miami and joined Wilhelmina Modelling Agency. As a <a href=#>model,</a> she advertised for brands such as eBay, Estee Lauder and Marc Ecko. In addition, she modelled for Playboy, Woman’s <a href=#>World</a>, Shape, Maxim, and the likes with her stunning looks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/017a377bdd63d065.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Megan Fliehr biography: husband, wedding, occupation, parents, siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At 17, she broadened her career base by enrolling in a drama school in New York. A year later, she was already auditioning for roles in Los Angeles. Her debut was in the Italian film <i>Natale a Miami</i> released in 2005. A breakthrough in her acting career came knocking in 2007 for staring as Eden Lord on the TV show <i>Nip/Tuck.</i></p><p class=align-left>Her role brought in a lot of fame for her, and from then on, she was soaring. The other two shows that pushed her further to the top are <i>American Heiress</i>, in which she starred as Loren Wakefield and the famous 90210, starring Naomi Clark. Over the years, she has appeared in countless movies and TV shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/86fe243a9fd8c19e.jpeg><p class=align-left>However, she did not pick on every role she was considered by casting directors. For instance, AnnaLynne passed the role of Heidi in <i>The Twilight Saga: New Moon</i> because she felt she needed some RR, rest and relaxation. Since the role could not wait for her, the casting director gave it to Noot Seear.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9dff4ccdb117916d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sarah Levy: husband, mother, siblings, net worth, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Worth mentioning are the multiple nominations and awards she has grasped as an <a href=#>actress</a>.

She even broke down in her rape scene in 90210. Her honorary acts earned her a U. S Congressional Honor and public recognition for championing against human trafficking and sexual violence.</p><p class=align-left>A lot more can be said of the great that has come out of AnnaLynne McCord.
