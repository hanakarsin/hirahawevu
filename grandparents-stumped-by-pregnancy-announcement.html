She begins referencing her toddler's outfit in an attempt to get their attention focused on what she was wearing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lee Buona (@lee_buona)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram | @lee_buona</span></figure><p>Although they're happily talking with the child, it doesn't seem like they're paying too much attention to the clothes on her body, something that Lee quips about in a text overlay of the video.</p><p>Undeterred, she attempts another method of ensuring that grandma and grandpa are able to organically discover the surprise she has in store for them.</p><p>She accomplishes this task by asking her child sweetly if he wants to sit on his grandpa's lap, which prompts him to lift the child and sit on his lap as he eats his meal.</p><p>Again, Lee makes a reference to her kids' clothes, hoping that the older couple will finally take a closer gander at what their grand child is wearing.</p><p>It doesn't seem to work — as she continues to record it's becoming more and more evident that her and partner may need a bit more of a nudge in the right direction.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram | @lee_buona</span></figure><p>So he picks up his kid and directly tells grandma and grandpa to read what his shirt says. They both finally take a look at it, and then, after a beat of comedic timing that probably couldn't even have been scripted as perfectly, grandma asks: "what does it say?" straining to look at the text on the child's shirt.</p><p>The TikTok then cuts to Lee's partner plopping their child right down on the table in front of them and smoothing out his clothes.</p><p>Finally, it dawns on them: "No, really?" Grandma asks, looking into the camera before she gets up and runs on over to the couple for a hug.</p><p>In an epilogue of sorts for the video, Lee shows back up on camera to relay that she wishes she was recording after grandpa, who it took a bit longer to understand she was pregnant, asked innocently how her child was going to be "a brother."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram | @lee_buona</span></figure><p>Laughing, she explained to him that no...her son is the one going to be a brother.</p><p>Judging from the comments left by other users on the platform, it seems that there were a lot of people who have had similarly frustrating experiences with their own folks.</p><p>Like this Instagram user who penned: "My mom did the exact same to my brother and SIL. Took 45 minutes."</p><p>However there was someone else on the other side of the surprise who said that they were similarly slow on the draw when it came to recognizing the announcement, but gave a very sweet reason as to why this is the case.</p><p>"I didn’t get it either. My son and daughter-in-law had a shirt made for our granddaughter that said ' im a big sister '. Just tell us y’all! You don’t understand how hard it is to see through our bifocals we’re not looking at the clothes we’re looking at the babies face," they quipped.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram | @lee_buona</span></figure><p>For others, the video was about recognizing the joy that emanated from the grandparents' faces the second they realized what was going on: "I literally saw the lightbulb come on above your dad's head when he finally figured it out. Now I know where that expression comes from!"</p><p>But there are also those who said that they couldn't blame grandma and grandpa for taking it so long to figure it out: "To be fair the word brother was very small," they penned.</p><p>What do you think? Did the soon-to-be double grandparents use up an inordinate amount of time unraveling the pregnancy mystery? Or have you been in similar situations and think that because they weren't necessarily looking for an announcement, that it makes sense for them to have not seen it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2BiusOpmKudnqnAbr%2FTrqSpnZRir7p5z6ucoKaRo7C6ecCnpaitnpiyrrHNrQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgrandparents-stumped-by-pregnancy-announcement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./736530-nnamdi-kanu-wears-biafra-themed-attire-court-photos-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./736530-nnamdi-kanu-wears-biafra-themed-attire-court-photos-html.html>Photos: Nnamdi Kanu wears Biafra attire to court</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./francois-chau-html.html>Francois Chau - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./francois-chau-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
