In the cause of our investigation, he implicated one person whom they live in the same house with.</p><p>“In continuation of our investigations of the first person, he said it was someone in Tafawa Balewa who approached him that he was looking for a rifle to buy and that is what prompted him to carry that gun. When he gave us the name of the person, we went and arrested him.</p><p>“When we arrested him, he confessed to us that it is true that he is looking for rifle to buy because something terrible happened to him, that his house alongside those of others were burned during the last December 2021 incident that occurred following the Baba Peter Gonto memorial anniversary.</p><p>“He mentioned names of some people, including that of the former Speaker in connection to the incident, saying that, that is the reason why he is looking for a rifle to kill him (Dogara), and so, we launched an investigation in that regard.</p><p>“One thing with human beings is, if he is guilty, he would not want to admit until you use wisdom, so we have intensified our investigations. And on the missing rifle in our armory, I directed that our armory be audited and in the cause of auditing, we discovered that apart from the two rifles we intercepted, some were not in the armory and so we have expanded our investigations.”</p><h2>Missing Rifles</h2><p>On the missing rifle, the Police Commissioner revealed that he had directed the auditing of the armory, and they discovered that apart from the two rifles gotten from the arrested suspects, some others were missing.</p><p>He said: “Now that I am talking to you, our armory officer who retired two years ago was arrested day before yesterday because we have been looking for him and now he is in our custody. We were still investigating and we saw that he has written to the IGP and is alleging that we didn’t call to inform him. I can tell you, if not because of what that man said, he would not discover any statement from another person that his life is at stake.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FqZrCgqWK2bsPAp6tmrJ9iuKq4y2adqKqdmr9utM6uqp5ln5t6s7HPrGSsqJWWuKa%2BjJ2moJmilnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-i-want-to-kill-former-house-of-reps-speaker-dogara.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./i-refused-to-sue-a-company-that-duped-me-because-of-nigerias-judicial-system-basketmouth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./i-refused-to-sue-a-company-that-duped-me-because-of-nigerias-judicial-system-basketmouth.html>I Refused To Sue A Company That Duped Me Because Of Nigeria's Judicial System Basketmouth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./skai-jackson-html.html>Skai Jackson - Edad, Familia, Biografa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./skai-jackson-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
