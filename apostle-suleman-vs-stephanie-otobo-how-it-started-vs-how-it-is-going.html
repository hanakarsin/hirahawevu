You were never the one who sent me out of that ministry. I was tired of your ungodliness as a leader. And that was the major reason I left that ministry. So, forget those manipulations and cheap lies,” Davis said.</p><p>He pressed further that; “We all know the part I played in the Stephanie Otobo saga. You know as much as I do. How much involved I was in bringing that saga to a halt. I don’t even need to mention names. You knew how we got Stephanie Otobo to come to the altar and apologise to mama (Suleman’s wife) and brought Stephanie Otobo’s mother to Auchi.”</p><p>Amidst all, Apostle Suleman has continued to deny having s3xual intercourse with Otobo.</p><p>He berated her claims and described it as an attempt to distract his ministry by all forms of fabrications.</p><p>However, while all seems to have died down with nobody able to drill to the truth of the matter, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Otobo</strong></a> has come up again with images to patch her claims.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the singer took to her social media pages on Monday, May 9 and posted disturbing s3xual images she allegedly took with Apostle Suleman in one of their encounters.</p><p>Otobo challenged Apostle Suleman to defend the scar part on ‘his thigh’ as shown on the recent images she uploaded on her social media pages.</p><p>She went further to call the attention of Nigerians to look closely at the finger nail of the cleric and the one sighted in the photo she had uploaded.</p><p>Otobo’s tweet reads: “Oracle of God, van you deny deny this? Your finger nail and the scar on your left thigh? Can you sent them too.? Apostle Johnson suleman, i hail o, Go through the thread, and listen to the video if you have any question. Your answers are right there.</p><p>“If these screenshots were fake, how did i get his pics that aren’t public pics at the first place and how come I’m the first to release this kind of pics of him? He has changed his hairstyle twice since i came out to speak up with receipts. He has done alot to appear different.</p><p>“If the dick pic isn’t his, what is he gonna say about the scar oh his left thigh? His wife can’t deny that scar. How did i know he has a scar on his left thigh if we we didn’t have intimacy?Lol. If he’s denying, he should open up his thigh let’s see. His nails too says it all.</p><p>“Some people kept on wondering why i came out esposing apostle Johnson suleman, and why i haven’t let go ever since.”</p><p>Otobo said she never planned to return to talks on the scandal but that Apostle Suleman pushed her to the wall and the only way she could fight back was to cry out and make everything known.</p><p>She claimed that the cleric had tried using police to shut her up because she visited Nigeria to do feature Timaya in a song.</p><p>She added: “I already paid Clarence Peters for the visuals of the song before oga arrested me, cos i refused to obey him to go back to Canada. He wanted me to amount to nothing.</p><p>“He did everything to stop my music music career. He was scared that I’ll be influencial. He even poisoned me, paid my friends to set me up and bribed some members of my fam to assassinate me. Lured me to come make false confession at his church in auchi that i lied against him.</p><p>“That it was other pastors and politicians that wanted to bring him down. How come no name was mentioned.? I only did that cos the pressure was toomuch and everyone had left ne to suffer alone. No support. I had to give up at that moment to have the opportunity for reinforcement.</p><p>“This man has done everything to end my life but God is not dead, this video is the complete story of how everything happened and how it’s going lately. I’ll release a comprehensive video of everything that happened and the answers to questions,” Otobo claimed in her tweet thread.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49yZpqon6jBrbGMrKylnZ2Wu27C0maqrZ2gna6vtcRmpq2nkqR6qbvWZqCtZaOprrPAxJ1kr6tdnby4ecitZKKrXZy8qrrGaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fapostle-suleman-vs-stephanie-otobo-how-it-started-vs-how-it-is-going.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./260025-mke-wangu-alipanda-mbegu-ya-ksh-28-milioni-kanisani-nifanye-nini-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./260025-mke-wangu-alipanda-mbegu-ya-ksh-28-milioni-kanisani-nifanye-nini-html.html>Mke wangu alipanda mbegu ya KSh 2.8 milioni kanisani, nifanye nini?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ariana-madix-html.html>Ariana Madix - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ariana-madix-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
