Jordan Fisher opened up exclusively with 'Distractify' about suiting up as Impulse in Season 8.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY IMAGES</span></figure><p>Season 7 of The CW's <a href=#>The Flash</a> introduced DC's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bart Allen</a>, aka Impulse, into the Arrowverse. However, instead of the future speedster being Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) and Iris West-Allen's grandson like the character is in the comic books, Bart is the couple's son.</p><p>Bart is introduced in the DC series in the season 7 finale, making an appearance alongside Iris and Barry's daughter Nora, who first appeared in the show in Season 5.</p><p>Unlike Nora, Bart is wildly impulsive, and as the older sister, Nora is constantly trying to keep a tight leash on her brother and help him rein in his emotions.</p><p><a href=#>Jordan Fisher</a>, who portrays the enthusiastic Impulse, opened up exclusively to Distractify about what he thinks of Bart's emotional tendencies and whether the character will continue to pop up throughout Season 8.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jordan Fisher talks portraying Bart Allen on 'The Flash.'</h2><p>Before tackling the role of Bart in the Arrowverse, the 27-year-old is a quadruple threat and has succeeded in the business as an accomplished actor, dancer, producer, and singer.</p><p>Best known for starring in the Netflix's hit rom-com To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You, based on the novel written by Jenny Han, Jordan made his debut as Bart in The Flash's milestone 150th episode.</p><p>"He's young ... He's, like, 19 and very much still trying to figure things out," Jordan, who partnered with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starbucks BAYA Energy</a> for their latest campaign, told us. The actor explained that Bart "definitely struggles" with the pressure to live up to his father's legacy.</p><p>"[Bart] knows that he's really, really powerful, and really strong, and way faster than his dad would have been at that age, and has more skills and all sorts of things like that," he continued, adding, "But ... Bart wants to be Bart more than anything ... beyond Impulse, beyond the Flash, or even the idea of becoming the Flash one day, Bart wants to be [himself]. He just wants to be his own thing. I think everybody deals with that at some point in time, right?"</p><p>Fans of the series love to watch storyline crossover events and future characters appearing in the present-day timeline. After Nora and Bart appeared in Season 8, Episode 6, many fans are wondering if the actors will continue to reprise their roles as Bart and Nora and pop up throughout the season.</p><p>"Guess we'll have to wait to find out," Jordan cheekily told us. Though the actor wouldn't drop any major spoilers about returning to Team Flash, we're pretty sure this won't be the last time we see The CW star suit up as Impulse.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jordan Fisher's character Bart Allen deviates from the comic books.</h2><p>Since Bart is not the son of Don Allen (Barry's son) and Meloni Thawne like in the DC comic books, he is not from the 30th century. Though Bart was not introduced in The CW series until the Season 7 finale, fans know that the timeline is constantly in flux due to Team Flash consistently altering events.</p><p>As we've seen throughout the Arrowverse, small changes in the timeline can create a large-scale ripple effect. For example, when Nora was first introduced in Season 5, she did not know her father because he got lost in the Speed Force while battling the Reverse-Flash.</p><p>After Nora's newspaper article — and the course of the timeline — are altered, the Nora fans see in Season 8 is the one who grew up with both of her parents. Additionally, this isn't the first time that the superhero drama has changed the comic's family lineage. For instance, initially, Wally (Keiynan Lonsdale) is Iris's nephew, but on The Flash, he's actually her brother.</p><p>On the CW series, Jesse Wells, aka Jesse Quick (Violett Beane), is the daughter of Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), but she was originally the daughter of the Justice Society heroes Liberty Belle and Johnny Quick.</p><p>Fans of the series know that The Flash does not completely align with the comic book version, and we're totally OK with that.</p><p>The Flash airs on The CW every Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p><a href=#>Reporting by: Gabrielle Bernardini</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJuZoql6orjLnqVmoZ5iwamxjJ%2BjmquY</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bart-allen-in-the-flash.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./latest-political-news-in-nigeria-for-today-tuesday-3rd-may-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./latest-political-news-in-nigeria-for-today-tuesday-3rd-may-2022.html>Latest Political News In Nigeria For Today, Tuesday, 3rd May, 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-beast-must-die-true-story.html>Is 'The Beast Must Die' Based on a True Story?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-beast-must-die-true-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
