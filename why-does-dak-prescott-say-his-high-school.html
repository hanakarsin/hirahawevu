Let's discover the reason why.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Since his <a href=#>NFL</a> debut in the 2016 season, Dallas Cowboys quarterback <a href=#>Dak Prescott</a> has been in the spotlight. From being the fourth rookie QB to open the Cowboys season as a starter to winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, it seems Dak had a great first year in the pros.</p><p>As the years go by, Dak continues to get better and better; however, his 2020 run was cut short after a season-ending injury during Week 5. After signing a four-year contract extension, Dak returned to action 11 months after his injury and proved to be back and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">better than ever</a>.</p><p>Since then, Dak has led the <a href=#>Cowboys</a> to an 11-4 record in the 2021 season, and the franchise clinched the NFC East division title after a 56-14 blowout victory against the <a href=#>Washington Football Team</a> on Dec. 26.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Most NFL players dedicate their professional success to their collegiate-level playing experience. However, Dak Prescott owes his football legacy to his high school â€” Haughton High School â€” and continuously expresses his gratitude for all the school and football program gave him.</p><p>But, it can be confusing because rather than stating his college alma mater, Dak Prescott says his high school during NFL introductions. We know he went to college (he attended Mississippi State), so why doesn't he acknowledge MSU? Why does he always say his high school during intros? Keep reading to find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Dak Prescott say his high school during introductions?</h2><p>After a devastating right ankle fracture and dislocation, Dak Prescott made his NFL return 11 months later during <a href=#>Thursday Night Football</a>. The Cowboys QB faced off against Tom Brady and the reigning Super Bowl champions â€” the Tampa Bay Buccaneers â€” and threw for a whopping 403 yards and three touchdowns.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What a first game back for <a href=#>@Dak</a>:<br>ðŸ”¹ 403 passing yards<br>ðŸ”¹ 3 passing TD<br>ðŸ”¹ 101.4 passer rating</p><p>So great to see him out there again. <a href=#>#DALvsTB</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1dlX33WvQg</a></p>â€” NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>September 10, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>While fans should've focused on his outstanding stats, many were thrown off by his TNF broadcast introduction. Rather than stating his name and college alma mater â€” Mississippi State â€” Dak chose to mention his high school, Haughton High School.</p><p>That seems odd, right? Well, Dak's high school means a lot to him; plus, shouting out the HHS must have made the football program ecstatic.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dak Prescott excelled in football at Haughton High School.</h2><p>As the quarterback of the Haughton Buccaneers, Dak was truly remarkable. He had the instincts of a leader, and his football IQ was higher than most.</p><p>As a senior, Dak led the Buccaneers to a 10-0 record; he also ran for 950 yards and 17 touchdowns that season. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dispatch</a> reported that by the end of his high school career, Dak "had thrown for more than 5,000 yards and 66 touchdowns."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dak Prescott became a starter in high school, college and now the NFL because the starter in front of him was injured.</p>â€” Kate Hairopoulos (@khairopoulos) <a href=#>August 27, 2016</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The outlet also spoke with Roy Lang, the sports editor at the Shreveport Times, about Dak Prescott's presence on the high school football field.</p><p>"Dak was very quiet, not a big 'me' guy," he said. "You could definitely tell he commanded respect from his teammates, even at a young age. He was very polite and polished. Heart and soul of that team."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxllJa4brzRnqqcp6SperSt2GafoqtdnbaotIysmqGnn6E%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-dak-prescott-say-his-high-school.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./inec-to-spend-n305bn-on-2023-general-election-see-breakdown.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./inec-to-spend-n305bn-on-2023-general-election-see-breakdown.html>INEC To Spend N305bn On 2023 General Election [See Breakdown]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mills-watson-html.html>Mills Watson - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mills-watson-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
