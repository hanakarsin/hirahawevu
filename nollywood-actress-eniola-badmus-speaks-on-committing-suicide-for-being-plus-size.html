<time>18 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Eniola-Badmus-1000x600.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Plus size Nigerian movie actress, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Eniola Badmus,</strong></a> has described as depressive some body-shaming comments by social media users on chubby women.</h2><p>The 43-year-old actress while speaking in a recent interview with Saturday beats said although some of the <strong>derogatory comments by netizens could cause some people to be depressed, and even commit suicide</strong>, but that she would not let that happen with her.</p><p>Badmus noted that she did not come into the entertainment industry with a skinny body, hence she cannot allow negative comments about her body to get to her.</p><p>She noted that the pressure that comes with body-shaming is sometimes too much for some persons to bear, hence it should be stopped. Badmus said it is a wonder to see how social media feel they can lecture people how to leave their lives.</p><p>The actress also berates bloggers who always look out for trolls on celebrities, feeding on their negativity.</p><p>She said: “It is not everything I can talk about but sometimes, some things get to me. I have developed a tough skin over time but I am also human. When things become overwhelming, I have to express myself and pour out my thoughts. Everyone has a threshold on different matters. The way people go about body shaming is hilarious. I did not come into the industry as a skinny girl. I have always been a chubby girl. It is now when I am trimming down that the comments are coming.</p><p>“I know I have not seen the end of this and I cannot control people’s opinions. However, I think it is important to caution body shamers.</p><p>“The pressure that comes with these things is too much and could lead to depression. I tell people that I can never be depressed, no matter how much they troll me. I would rather put my energy into partying. But, some people cannot handle it. For instance, the only reason bloggers pick up one’s story is when they notice that a fan has slandered one or made uncouth comments and one replied. Some people then go to the comments section to laugh. They feed on that negativity. Families and society also need to be more considerate because they are guilty too. Some family members play around it by calling one ‘orobo (fat)’.</p><p>Badmus continued saying: “I just tell people to leave me alone. Some of the responses I gave to hateful comments about my weight were not because they got to me to the point of committing suicide. It was just to shut up toxic people. People on social media feel they have a right to talk to one in certain ways. You need to see the volume of messages I get every time.”</p><p>Speaking about her benefits so far in the entertainment industry and being a public eye, she said, “Some of the things I have enjoined by being a public figure include the fame and accolades that come with it. That is not to mention the opportunities, followership and admiration from well-meaning people. Sometimes, I even get things for free. I did not know I would be popular while I was aspiring to become an actress and moviemaker. I also did not foresee the stress. I plunged myself into acting because it was my passion but I did not know I would end up having sleepless nights or having innumerable commitments.”</p><p>In another news, Naija News reports that veteran <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nollywood producer, Chico Ejiro is dead.</strong></a></p><p>The Nollywood veteran filmmaker died in the early hours of Friday, December 25, 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5FvZqennKHGuLvOnWSam6SnsrS%2FjJ6loqeclnqjrcOmrKxlo6WyorfSZqanZZOkuq61062gp59dqMKqr8idnGaen6d6o7HIp55mqJyqwG6%2FyLOcaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnollywood-actress-eniola-badmus-speaks-on-committing-suicide-for-being-plus-size.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tinubu-visits-buhari-after-apc-presidential-primaries-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tinubu-visits-buhari-after-apc-presidential-primaries-photos.html>Tinubu Visits Buhari After APC Presidential Primaries [Photos]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-does-nfs-mean-on-wizz.html>NFS Is an Important Acronym Everyone Trying Wizz Should Understand</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-does-nfs-mean-on-wizz.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
