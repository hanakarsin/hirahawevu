If you were thinking about traveling to the USA, you might need to know what documents are needed. A letter of invitation is a good way to prove that you are a reliable citizen who has a valid reason for visiting and is not expected to ruin the welfare and stability of the country. So, here we are going to talk about how to invite someone from Nigeria to USA and how to write an invitation letter.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/0b75adb0c9c08eb0.jpeg><p class=align-left>Photo from nigerianpassports.com</p><h2>What is an invitation letter for a U.S. visa?</h2><p class=align-left>An invitation letter for U.S. visa is an informal document, a letter that is sent to a person who is requesting his or her presence to make a visit to the USA.

Over a long period, the U.S. government has registered many cases when Nigerians entered the USA and overstayed the visit or never left. While an invitation letter is not an official document required to get the U.S. visa but it helps to show to the consular officer that visitor’s intention is genuine.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, if someone is traveling to visit a family member or a friend, on business, attend a conference in the USA, it would be better if the host could write and send an invitation letter for visa.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> American Embassy in Nigeria: visa requirements</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/69a0ff0378e8f61f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Photo from travelwahala.com</p><h2>How can I invite someone from Nigeria to USA?</h2><p class=align-left>It is totally understandable that if you are the U.S. citizen or resident who has relatives in Nigeria, you would like to have them visit the United States. However, this can be not an easy thing to do. The reasons why a Nigerian citizen needs to visit the United States are not always clear to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. For this purpose, the U.S. citizen or resident might need to send a letter of invitation to the U.S. Embassy to reassure the consular officers that an invited person is not going to break the U.S. law.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d3b4469ec542b176.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a good and successful internship letter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In general, an invitation letter to the USA cannot guarantee that the visa will be issued. The thing is an invitation letter is not even an official document, but it helps to clarify the travel intentions of the Nigerian visitor. While an invitation letter cannot be based on the sponsor’s assurance, an invited person must apply for the visa according to his/her own circumstances. On the basis of the invitation letter, visa application, and interview, consular officers determine whether or not the visa applicant will get a visa.</p><p class=align-left>Once you agreed on the trip details with your friend or relative from Nigeria, you can write a letter of invitation. It may seem a little awkward, but you will have to explain the consular officer why your invitee should be allowed to enter the country. So, tell them why he/she is not a dangerous person but not in such a direct manner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4c7c834cf45de0ab.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Easy guide on how to write a letter of invitation</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As mentioned above, in the invitation letter you need to include information that a visitor has strong ties to the home country, for example, close family, property, a good job, studies, etc. that he would not normally abandon.</p><p class=align-left>Writing a letter of invitation is not necessary, but it helps in getting your family member or friend from Nigeria approved for a tourist or business visa.

They are the following:</p><ul><li>the applicant must have a residence in Nigeria to which he will return after the temporary visit</li><li>the applicant intends to enter the USA for a specific period</li><li>the applicant goes to the U.S. to engage in legitimate activities like a business, tourism, visiting family members or friends, etc.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The proof of residence is basically determined by applicant’s ties to his country. These ties may include property ownership, university studies, family and/or employment. Each applicant’s situation is unique and is considered individually by the U.S. Embassy.</p><p class=align-left>The second requirement refers to the duration of the visit. Most of the time, business/tourist visa implies short visits. The visa applicant from Nigeria must demonstrate to the consular officers that his travel intentions fall within the particular visa class’s parameters. Applicants must also be able to demonstrate that he is planning to return from the U.S. to his residence in Nigeria in a timely manner. Remember that the person should be going just for a few weeks or so. If the visitation is longer than that, the U.S. Embassy may become suspicious. If someone would like to visit for 4,5 or 6 months, he/she will probably be denied unless there is a strong reason to do so.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt2h5dt70q4l5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find out how much does it cost to get married in Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The third requirement refers to the appropriate use of the visa. The applicant must convince the consular officers that the activities in which he will be engaged in during the visit to the U.S. are legal and consistent with the visa class.</p><p class=align-left>Note that young people are under a higher risk of being denied. If the young person has no money, property, he or she will be probably denied as they will be suspected in an attempt to live and work illegally in the USA. People who are traveling with their spouse or children are also at risk because they have less significant ties. This is not a definite rule, but this is to give you a general idea of how the system works. In any case, the trip must be sponsored, so the absence of the sponsor is highly important. Otherwise, you must be able to sponsor yourself and have something reasonable in your account.</p><p class=align-left>There often happens that Nigerian students are concerned with the chances of getting a visa to the USA as they lack experience and money. The truth is that student is a category of applicants that are at the lower risk of being denied because of the strong tie to the home country, that is studies. If the person who is inviting is student’s parent, family member living and working in the USA legally, that is enough to get a visa. One condition is that student’s age must be no more than 18.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/8c4b3a551439bf50.jpeg><p class=align-left>Photo: queensofvirtue.com</p><p class=align-left>If the student meets the above criteria, his host can write an invitation letter to the U.S. embassy. Other documents may include sponsor’s account statements, receipt of payment, certificate of birth, statement of the income and other.</p><p class=align-left>In most cases, counselor officer does not even look at the documents, he asks 3 questions to determine applicant’s eligibility. These questions are: Where in the USA are you visiting? What do you do for a living? Who is your sponsor?</p><p class=align-left>Remember that all the ties to the home country must be proved officially. For example, if one of the applicant’s proves is a job, business or property, he must be able to prove his ownership or position by providing specific documents.
